This project is used for clear the useless post generated by vncserver.

When you startup a vnc, it will generate a files at /tmp/.X11-unix/X[port] and /tmp/.X[port]-locked

In the /tmp/.X[port]-locked, you can see it contins a process id for this vnc.

When there is someting wrong with the vnc, it will crashed, so the vnc process will be destroyed, that means this .X[port]-locked will be removed.

But the related files in the .X11-unix/X[port] will not be removed.

So this is what we do.
